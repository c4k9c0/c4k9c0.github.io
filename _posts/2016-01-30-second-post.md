title: A Regular Routine

## What did you do last week?  

Over the past week I have become acclimated to this class. Last week I thought this class was going to be daughting.After my actions this week I no longer feel this way.  

I started the week off working on the Collatz project. I was careful to create good issues on Github and commit often, because a significant portion of our grade is the quality of our repository.  I understand this project is designed to get us used to using Github’s issue tracker, but coming up with five issues was a bit challenging. After the preliminary set up steps were complete, I began programming. I feel confident in my current solution, but have plans to add a few more optimizations.  

Lecture was also improved over last week. The notation of a quiz everyday seemed overly ambitious. I now realized that quizzes only cover readings and information from the previous class. Because of their simplistic nature computers are not allowed on the quiz. I think this is a mistake. Many times in industry, at least from my experience, you will need to quickly look up and process a piece of information. No one knows everything, that’s what Google is for. I think quizzes would be more rewarding if they tested us on material that we had not covered in class, but we could look up. This would increase our ability to input, search, and parse information effectively.  

## What is blocking you?  

Fortunately there was nothing that impeded my progress this week. Sphere being down is a bit of a nascence, but nothing that can’t be dealt with.  

## Tip of the week  

Cute puppies and unlimited private repositories round out this week’s post. This week I was introduced to [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Gitlab is a spinoff of Github, except for the fact that you get unlimited private repos for free. That’s pretty neat. Almost as neat as a [robot](http://www.petbot.co/) that keeps tab on your pet while you are at work.
