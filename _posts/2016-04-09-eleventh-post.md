title: I-D-Be Done with Part 2
---

## What did you do last week?  

This week my team and I finished part 2 of the IDB project. My group got off to a good start two weeks ago, so we did not have that much to do this week. We wrote unit tests and got them to run on our website. The most challenging part of last week was getting a dummy database set up on Travis. After much googling and failed builds my team and I figured it out.

## What will you do next week?  

Next week I again plan to start early on the assignment. I am interested to see what we are going to do with other people's API. Hopefully it won't be too time consuming because I think the search functionality will be.

## What is blocking you?  

Nothing is currently blocking me. Check back next week and this section will be more interesting.

## Class Experience  

This week we did a deep dive into SQL. SQL isn't that complex and many people have experience in it. For this reason I feel like we could have spent class time more effectively. I would have rather spent more time talking about regular expressions. In addition to spending more time on regular expressions I would have liked to spend a bit of time talking about Angular and Flask. Had I not had Angular experience I feel like this project would be much harder. 

## Tip of the week  

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generators are a great way to scaffold a web app. [Here](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme) is one to create an Angular app. [Here](https://github.com/koistya/react-static-boilerplate) is one to create a React app.
