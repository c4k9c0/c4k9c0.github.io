title: Calm After the Storm

##What did you do last week?  

This past week I wrapped up the Collatz project. After many failed attempts to get my solution to pass sphere, I gave up that endeavor. I was surprised my solution did not work. Other people in the class with similar solutions got Sphere working. Once I was done with Collatz I had some free time on my hands. I spent it getting familiar with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) because I plan to use it on projects 3, 4, and 5.  

##What is blocking you?  

Fortunately nothing blocked me this week. I was able to do the majority of the reading, even though it was not covered on the quiz Friday. What could that possibly say about Monday...?  

##What will you do next week?  

With project two on the horizon, I plan to start that as soon as it is assigned. I work during the week so it would have been nice to start project two this weekend. Conversely this might be one of the only weekends I have nothing to do for this class. I plan to take advantage of this luxury.  

##Class Experience  

So far this class has been rewarding. I like the way Dr. Downing is slowly getting into the technicalities of Python, giving us plenty of examples along the way. It is also nice that he puts everything on Github, that way you can focus on the material rather than copying it down.  

##Tip of the week  

This week's tip hopefully will increase your productivity. I feel like I should have know about [workspaces](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2894354/dont-forget-one-of-linuxs-best-features-how-to-use-multiple-workspaces.html) long ago. Never the less I find them a good way to stay organized. I like to have one workspace for development, one for Google, and one for testing.
