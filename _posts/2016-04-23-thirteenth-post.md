title: I-D-Be Done with Part 3
---

## What did you do last week?  

Last week my group and I wrapped up the final part of the project. If you read last week's post, you'll know that we were experimenting with the best way to implement search. We were able to get Whoosh working on a SQLite database but not a MySQL database. There were Docker errors. Because of this, we ended up implementing search on our own. I learned a lot and am glad we didn't use a library to solve the problem.

## What will you do next week?  

Next week marks the start of our last sprint. In the middle of the sprint is a presentation and at the end is a test. I am much more prepared for the presentation than the test. I should probably study for the test. Amidst balancing those two things, we have some final touches to put on our website.

## What is blocking you?  

Currently the only thing left to do in part 3 of the lab is to implement another teams API. We have the page done, we just need to deploy it to production. Hopefully we don't have any Docker issues.

## Class Experience  
 
Finally I feel like we got to the software engineering part of the course. I really liked talking about all the different design patterns. I only wish Dr. Downing would display multiple files on the screen at once. It is sometimes hard to remember what the old file looked like before the changes.

## Tip of the week  

Today while watching the NBA playoffs an announcer said that, "Comparison is the thief of happiness". As we approach final's season remember to do the best you can independent of your peers.
