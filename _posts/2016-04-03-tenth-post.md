title: Week 10

## What did you do last week?  

Last week the work load for my other classes was relatively low. I took this opportunity and got started on project 4. My team and I started by setting up a dummy database with sqlite. We then implemented our API which sat on top of this database. Finally we replaced our sqlite database with a mysql database and pushed the images to Carina. [Here](http://nflarrests.me/api/teams) is the finished API.

## What will you do next week?  

With much of project 4 already finished, hopefully this week will not be too stressful. All that remains for project 2 is writting our unit tests, and adding to our technical report. I plan to start the report tonight and meet with my group early this week to write the tests.

## What is blocking you?  

As stated above, we still need to write unit tests. I am not sure how we are suppose to run the tests on Travis. I saw there was a resource posted on Piazza about the subject so if I can't figure it out, I will look there.

## Class Experience  

This week we covered two topics: XML and Regular expressions. I thought the XML material was a tad dry, but it was useful information. In the middle of the week we had a speaker from Atlassian. I liked how they introduced substitute technologies to the ones we use. This goes to show there are many ways to fill a need. Finally we talked about regular expressions. We only scratched the surface so I hope we talk more about them on Monday.

## Tip of the week  

I have only used regular expressions a few times. I liked to test my expressions using [this](https://regex101.com/) tool. It is useful because it helps you see what characters are being selected, by which parts of the expression.
