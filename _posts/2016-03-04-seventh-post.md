## What did you do last week?  

Last week I spent a number of hours studying for the exam. I think I did alright, especially on the programming questions. For a more indepth analysis, keep reading.  

## What is blocking you?  

The only thing blocking me from spring break is next week.  

## What will you do next week?  

On Monday, according to the schedule, we will be assigned the first third of project 3. When I am not studying for midterms, I plan to get started on project 3. I will also be interested in seeing how lecture changes next week. On Wednesday Dr. Downing said we were done with Python.  

## Class Experience  

Finally we arive at what I want to talk about most, the test. To anyone thinking about taking this class, here is what I wish I would have known. When Dr. Downing says "you will need to be able to write python code", he means, "you will need to be able to rewrite the code we wrote in class". That isn't how I would write a test but I am not a professor so it doesn't matter what I would do. When Dr. Downing posts a list of short answer topics, you should copy down the definitions to your cheatsheet. My cheat sheet foused on the syntax of python and it hurt me on the short answers. While it is completly fair to have definitions on the test (especially since we knew what terms would be covered), it is still frusterating. That part of the test tested the quality of your cheatsheet, not your knowledge of the topics covered.  

## Tip of the week  

ESPN does not believe in public APIs. As a substitue, at least for college football, I found [this](https://collegefootballapi.com/) API. It needs some work still, but hopefully it will be ready this coming fall.
