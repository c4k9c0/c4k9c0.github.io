## What did you do last week?  

For the most part I took the last week off. After working so hard on the project I didn't feel as guilty as I otherwise would. Towards the end of the week I began studying for the upcoming exam. I feel like I made good progress, but there is still a lot to review.

## What will you do next week?  

My group is the 2nd to last group to present. Because of this we still need to run through our presentation. When we are done with this I plan to continue studying for the exam on Thursday.

## What is blocking you?  

We are done with the development of our site. However for whatever reason, Docker decides to crash periodically. Before we present on Wednesday we need to get Docker to play nice or switch to something else.

## Class Experience  

This week we started presentations. I have really enjoyed seeing everyone's hard work. I only wish that presentations were a bit more technical. Presentations could provide an opportunity for React groups to teach Angular groups React, and vice versa. Sadly, each group only has 15 minutes so this is unfeasible.

## Tip of the week  

With the exam coming up I can't stress how important it is to check Piazza. Looking at other people's questions are a good way to make sure you understand the material. In addition I would print the class cheat sheet. Last exam I did not print the class sheet and regretted it.
