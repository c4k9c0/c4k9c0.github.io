## What did you do last week?  

In the last week I got acclimated to the third project. I spent most of my time reading about Docker, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. I think I now have a working understanding of the three. I then set aside time to go through the Carina tutorials provided by the guest speaker. For the most part, they were easy to follow and very detailed.

## What is blocking you?  

While I understand the basics of the software we are using, there is still so much more to learn. I plan on familiarizing myself with all the technology over the break.

## What will you do next week?  

In addition to learning the new material, I plan on implementing it. My team has divided into front end and back end. Currently we are using npm start to run our web app. By the end of the week I hope to have it hosted on Carina.

## Class Experience  

The week before spring break flew by pretty quickly. The quizzes this week were a little tricky. I wish there was a back button on them, but that seems like an unlikely addition.

## Tip of the week  

After spending many hours trying to figure out why my container image was changing on Docker Hub but not on the server I finally found the answer. In the file named "docker-compose-prod.yml" you need to put in your Docker Hub username. This was not included in the tutorial.
