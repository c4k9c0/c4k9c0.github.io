title: Test Week
---

## What did you do last week?  

Since the first midterm is this week, I spent the last week preparing for it. I started to study by looking at the code that Dr. Downing pushed to Github. While looking over example code is a good way to get started studying, there are better, less passive ways to study. With this in mind I also spent time rewriting the code Dr. Downing had us write in class.  

## What is blocking you?  

This past week we did not have an active assignment. Because of this, there was nothing that could have blocked my progress.  

## What will you do next week?  

In the coming week I plan to continue studying for the midterm. I also plan to invest in a longer power cord and possibly a surge protector since there are only 9 outlets in the testing room.  

## Class Experience  

We spent the last week talking about all the different ways you can pass arguments to functions in python. At first this was a little confusing but Dr. Downing did a good job of providing examples. In between talking about arguments we had a guest speaker come talk about open source projects. There was some good information in this talk but I would have like it to be more interactive with more example code from the libraries.  

## Tip of the week  

In the spirit of open source, I will share a cool library I have used in the past. Normally you can't do version control on a PowerPoint. [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) works to solve this problem. It provides functionality so you can create PowerPoints using html and markdown. This allows you to check your slides in an out of a repository when you previously couldn't.
