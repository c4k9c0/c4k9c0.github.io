title: I-D-Be Done With Project 3
---

## What did you do last week?  

Last week I concentrated my efforts on finishing project 3. My team accomplished a lot over spring break, but there was still much to do. Many people on my team had Angular experience so developing the frontend was pretty easy for us. What gave us trouble was the backend. Wrestling to get Flask and Angular working together was where I spent most of my time.  

## What is blocking you?  

Since project 4 has not been assigned, nothing is blocking me. I imagine once we start project 4 many things will be blocking me. Although that is why Stack Overflow was invented.  

## What will you do next week?  

While I was working on project 3, I was neglecting other classes. Early next week I plan to take time catching up in other classes. Once I catch up I will begin working on project 4. Our project is already dynamic, so hopefully we replace just need to replace the implementation of our Angular Services.  

## Class Experience  

This past week we wrapped up Python and began talking about relational algebra. I was surprised that this was the topic after Python. I was expecting to cover refactoring. This topic is appropriate however, considering that in project 4 we will set up a database. Everything we have covered so far regarding relational algebra, was covered in CS 347. With that being said CS 347 is by no means a prerequisite for this class.  

## Tip of the week  

Here is a really great JavaScript library. [lodash](https://lodash.com/) makes iteration and composite functions really easy! I would suggest it to anyone who is working on this project.
