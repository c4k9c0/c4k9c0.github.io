## What did you do last week?  

Last week I spent most of my time in the library studying for the three tests I had Thursday. This class took precedence however, and I studied for it much more than the other two. I think it paid off but we will see for sure next week when grades are due. 

## What will you do next week?  

This week I do not foresee any difficulties. I only have one final and it is a week from Tuesday, the last day of finals. Since I have so much free time I may go back and modify parts of our IDB website after getting ideas from other groups.

## What is blocking you?  

Currently nothing is blocking me. I should probably enjoy it while it lasts.

## Class Experience  

Last Thursday we had our final test. I thought this one was structured a lot better than the last one. The fact that there were no short answers meant I didn't have to copy from my cheat sheet onto the test. I thought the questions themselves were fair because we had covered almost all of them in class.

## Tip of the week  

Over the past weeks I, and I think many of you have started to run out of cool tips. I will say this however. Don't waste your summer. Try to learn something or expand your world view.
