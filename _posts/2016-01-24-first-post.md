title: What a Week
---

First weeks are always hectic. This one was no different. Between work, buying books, and getting a feel for professors I was exhausted come Friday. With that said, this week was productive. One thing that stood out to me right away was how interactive this class was. Compared to classes in which professors lecture for an hour, I appreciated that this class was more of a conversation than a lecture.  

After class I spent my time learning about Jekyll, Markdown, and Github pages. All of these tools seem easy to use and have a lot of potential. I plan to use these tools to create a personal website. I am still learning, so hopefully this blog will improve as the semester continues. Stay tuned.  

I have always been one to start assignments early, so I next began the Collatz project. I ran into trouble getting the tests to pass. As a result, I could not get the given code to build on Travis CI. I suspect I may have misconfigured something when I was setting up my workspace. In the next week, possibly even later today, I plan to set up a workspace on a lab machine. If that does not work, I will ask for help in the study session this Thursday.  

In the spirit of helping others, I found a really good way to learn CSS Selectors. When I was first teaching myself web development I played a game called [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/). The game centers around a hierarchical dinner table which contains different levels of silverware, plates, and food. Players must then write CSS selectors to pick up the items on the table. This game helped me tremendously, and I would suggest it as practice for anyone just getting started in web development.
