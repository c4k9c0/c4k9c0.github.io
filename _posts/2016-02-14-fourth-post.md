title: Netflix then Chill
---

## What did you do last week?  

This past week was all about starting the Netflix project. My partner and I first discussed ideas for good caches. We came up with some useful ones. We ran into some trouble cloning the public repo on the lab machines because it was so big. We kept getting the all too familiar "disk quota exceeded" error. To get around this we cloned the repo into the tmp directory. After we pushed our tests we got our RMSE calulation down to .98. If we have time this week we will try to get it down to .95.

## What is blocking you?  

The only thing blocking my partner and I's progess is Travis. Some of the caches we are using have not been cloned to the CS network. As a result our unit tests are failing. Once everything gets moved over, I suspect we will have nothing blocking us. 

## What will you do next week?  

This next week my partner and I plan on finishing up Netflix, and then chilling. We need to generate documentation and work on getting the root mean squared error below .95. Once we are done with the lab I plan to get ahead with the assigned reading.

## Class Experience  

In the majority of the CS classes I have taken, the material builds on itself. This is especially true in this class. Dr. Downing likes to revist previous examples and discuss how they can be improved. It is important to know the entire code base we have discussed in class. Dr. Downing could introduce a new topic, then use it to improve a previous example. If you are not familiar with the excisting code it can be hard to understand how the new topic improves the code.

## Tip of the week  

We are currently in the heart of interview season. As a result many people use [that one book](http://www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf) to help them prepare for technical interviews. For me, that is too many works. Instead I make sure I can solve this [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/) of common questions.
