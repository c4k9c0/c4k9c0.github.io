title: An Honest Opinion

## What did you do last week?  

In the past seven days my partner and I finished the Netflix lab. We got our RMSE beneath 1 fairly quickly but then struggled to get it under .95. I then proceeded to misread 2 quiz questions, causing my quiz average to drop.  

## What is blocking you?  

Currently nothing is blocking me. Since my project has been submitted I have nothing pressing to do. We have a test in two weeks. It will be interesting to see if we get another assignment or if we can dedicate 100% of our time to studying for the test.  

## What will you do next week?  

Over the course of next week I plan to start studying for our test. I am going to try to review a small part of the material every day. I believe this is the best way to study. When I am not studying for the exam I plan to look more into React and find a project group.  

## Class Experience  

At the start of the last week, Dr. Downing posted an article regarding women in computer science. People on both sides of the issue offered their opinion, so I figure I would share mine. The article stated that women were better programmers because they get their code accepted ~4% more often than men. It then stated that when women are not anonymous, their code is accepted much less frequently than men's. While this is a problem, I took umbrage with how the information was presented. The heart of the issue isn't whither women or men make better programmers. The issue is that women don't get their code accepted as often as they should. However by stating "Women are better programmers than men", you alienate a demographic that wants to help resolve the issue. I think a much better title for the article would be, "Women not getting the credit they deserve". That way you are not continuing the gender animosity, but directly addressing the issue.  


## Tip of the week  

I am sure everyone has heard this a million times, but start studying for the exam early. You are more likely to remember something the more times you see it.
